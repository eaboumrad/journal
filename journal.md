# Journal

## Week 1

+ Hour 1: Went through the command line tutorial. Solving the challenges was fun

+ Hour 2: did the extra challenges. Struggled a bit with #3: making alias permanent, but then I read the blog and edited the file .bash_profile and it worked! Got lost on Challenge 5, I can’t find the Git folder in c:/program files. Tried to go to GitBash, find path, create goto-projects in that folder (with touch), edited file and saved, but when I ran Gitbash the command didn’t work

+ Hour 3: read the “Additional commands” section and tried them out. Read glossary.

## Week 2

+ Hour 1: reviewed the *Command Line Crash Course*, downloaded *Anaconda*, created **journal.md** and started writing it in markdown. Read the original markdown post and tried some instructions. Decided to follow the [tutorial of *programming historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) because I liked how clear and simple it looked. Downloaded software requested by *programming historian*. I couldn't remember how to push this journal to git hub, so I googled it. I pushed the most recent version of this journal to GitHub.

+ Hour 2: installed Pandoc and Zotero. Learned what YAML metadata blocks are. Followed the *programming historian* tutorial and wrote

    * a poem
    * a shopping list for groceries
    * a poem by Dante with footnotes and an image with a caption! [^1]

[^1]: all of it in markdown, obviously

I also converted the .md file to .docx. When I opened it with word, I realized I had made a mistake: I didn't put a space after the # sign and my heading didn't look like a heading.

+ Hour 3: I converted my .md file into an html file! Installed Latex through <miktex.org> so that I can convert the file to **PDF** as well. Started reading about *Working with Bibliographies* while Latex downloads. I haven't been able to convert to PDF yet.

+ Hour 4: Tried again to convert my .md file to pdf from the command line. Had to wait a little bit (more packages were installing), but then it succeeded. Opened Zotero and saved some articles through the Chrome extension. Created a .bib file and opened it in VS. On the 9th try, I managed to create a footnote with my citation and a bibliography on a PDF file! Then, pushed this journal to GitHub.

## Week 3

+ Hour 1: Downloaded the MLA.csl and changed the style of the citations. Saved a pdf. Played more with citations and different styles. Checked for updates of MikTex because the command line kept suggesting it. Applied the YAML metadata to this journal. Never going back to MS Word again!

+ Hour 2: I looked up how to create nested lists in markdown and applied it to this journal. On the same [website](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/05-blockquotes.html) I found other interesting things and I applied them to my tutorial .md file:
    * Blockquotes: line starts with > 
    * Line Breaks: line ends with \
    * Ordered and Unordered lists
    * More about images and captions: ![image caption](image name)

+ Hour 3: Opened [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and tried to do Exercise 0. Couldn-t run python on the command line> bash gave me a "permission denied" message. I tried consulting online forums to solve the problem, but it didn't work. I installed Python 2.7, but it still didn't work. I downloaded ActiveState Python as suggested from *Learn Python the Hard Way*, but I don't know if installing it is a good idea. I got frustrated and decided to ask Prof. Smyth about it in tonight's class. Pushed journal to GitBash.

+ Hour 4: I borrowed *Learn Pyhton 3 the Hard Way* from the library yesterday. Did exercise 1-4 from the book.

## Week 4

+ Hour 1 
    * Downloaded Anaconda again and installed it according to Prof. Smyth's instructions
    * I did exercises 5-6 from *Learn Python the hard way*
    * Tried running Python from the command line. It says the version but doesn't run.

+ Hour 2
    * Used IDLE for *Learn Python the Hard Way*, exercises 7-10
    * Exercise 10 has a list of **Escape Sequences**, so I made a cheat sheet in Python. some of the escape sequences didn't work, maybe because I'm using IDLE?
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 3
    * Ex. 11-13 from *Learn Python the Hard Way*. Ran the script on the command line with inputs and variables, and it worked!

+ Hour 4
    * Ex. 14 - 15. This is fun. I kinda want to create my version of *Adventure* now...
    * Pushed goals and journal to GitHub

## Week 5

+ Hour 1

    * Wrote my Geospatial Humanities Project in Markdown with a Bibliography built on Zotero.
    * Reviewed the Markdown tutorial because I needed some info on how to convert files to PDF
    * Converted my escape_sequences.py to a .md file. However, I wasn't able to export to pdf from the command line because the command \: is unavailable in coding T1.

+ Hour 2

    * Created a .md file for my EdTech class project
    * Ex. 16 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way* . The script didn't work with VS and the command line, so I tried using IDLE. It works, if I do "Run Customized": I think there might be a problem with the path in Anaconda. I did the study drills, these were a little more challenging than usual! In the end, it worked.
    * Pushed to GitHub
    * Finished the [readings for Week 4](https://github.com/smythp/software-design-lab)

+ Hour 3

    * Ex. 17 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*. The study drill said to try and write all the program in one line, but mine didn't work. I'll try again when I'm a little more comfortable with Python.
    * Ex. 18: the program did run, but I haven't really grasped what to use it for. I'll see if the next exercises make it clearer.
    * Ex. 19: as the study drills suggested, I created my own function, including one where the user gives an input for the variables. However, I didn't do it in 10 different way, only 5.
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 4

    * Ex. 20 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*. Not bad, it worked! And I discovered what "seek" does and what is "+="
    * Ex. 21. It took me a bit to understand the "return" word and what it does, but in the end, it made sense.
    * Ex. 22: this is about writing a list of all the words I learnt in Python (called list_of_words.md) and what they do. I created a text file and I'll write a bit of it every time I practice and push it to GitHub (hopefully)
    * Pushed the list_of_words to Github!
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 5
    * Wrote my paper for Geospatial Humanities in markdown. Then, I exported it in Word to adjust the style (footnotes, images), and then exported it to PDF.

## Week 6

+ Hour 1

    * Installed Jekyll
    * [HTML Tutorial on W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
    * Created my html page for recipes! With picture and a list. And navigation bar.

+ Hour 2

    * Downloaded Zoom for class
    * Kept working on my html page. Added a poem between blockquotes.
    * Committed journal to GitHub.
+ Hour 3

    * Worked on my html page: added a link to a heading, changed style of one of the headings with the id tag.
    * Kept going through the HTML Tutorial
    * Created a second html page (connected to the first one) with a conversions table for US and metric system.

+ Hour 4

    * Set up the viewport meta for my html page...I din't thinki I could do responsive design on HTML this easily!

## Week 7

+ Hour 1: Kept working on my html document with [HTML Tutorial on W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp). 

    * HTML Responsive
    * HTML Computercode
    * HTML Semantics: tried to add a "figure" section to contain the image on mt html page, but the caption ends up under the paragraph instead of the picture. I don't know why. I tried removing the "hr" spacing, but it didn't fix it.
    * HTML Entities
    * HTML Symbols
    * HTML Emojis: added an emoji to my html page. Honestly, it's interesting that there are so many things I can do, but I think I'll just search for them as I need them...I don't think it would be useful to learn all these special symbols and characters.
    * HTML Charset
    * HTML URL Encode: Finally I understand what the different parts of a URL are.
    * HTML XHTML
    * HTML Style Guide: this was useful...my html looks pretty messy at this point, so I'm gonna make it tidier.

+ Hour 2:
    * Pushed journal to GitHub
