# Journal

## Week 1

+ Hour 1: Went through the command line tutorial. Solving the challenges was fun

+ Hour 2: did the extra challenges. Struggled a bit with #3: making alias permanent, but then I read the blog and edited the file .bash_profile and it worked! Got lost on Challenge 5, I can’t find the Git folder in c:/program files. Tried to go to GitBash, find path, create goto-projects in that folder (with touch), edited file and saved, but when I ran Gitbash the command didn’t work

+ Hour 3: read the “Additional commands” section and tried them out. Read glossary.

## Week 2

+ Hour 1: reviewed the *Command Line Crash Course*, downloaded *Anaconda*, created **journal.md** and started writing it in markdown. Read the original markdown post and tried some instructions. Decided to follow the [tutorial of *programming historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) because I liked how clear and simple it looked. Downloaded software requested by *programming historian*. I couldn't remember how to push this journal to git hub, so I googled it. I pushed the most recent version of this journal to GitHub.

+ Hour 2: installed Pandoc and Zotero. Learned what YAML metadata blocks are. Followed the *programming historian* tutorial and wrote

    * a poem
    * a shopping list for groceries
    * a poem by Dante with footnotes and an image with a caption! [^1]

[^1]: all of it in markdown, obviously

I also converted the .md file to .docx. When I opened it with word, I realized I had made a mistake: I didn't put a space after the # sign and my heading didn't look like a heading.

+ Hour 3: I converted my .md file into an html file! Installed Latex through <miktex.org> so that I can convert the file to **PDF** as well. Started reading about *Working with Bibliographies* while Latex downloads. I haven't been able to convert to PDF yet.

+ Hour 4: Tried again to convert my .md file to pdf from the command line. Had to wait a little bit (more packages were installing), but then it succeeded. Opened Zotero and saved some articles through the Chrome extension. Created a .bib file and opened it in VS. On the 9th try, I managed to create a footnote with my citation and a bibliography on a PDF file! Then, pushed this journal to GitHub.

## Week 3

+ Hour 1: Downloaded the MLA.csl and changed the style of the citations. Saved a pdf. Played more with citations and different styles. Checked for updates of MikTex because the command line kept suggesting it. Applied the YAML metadata to this journal. Never going back to MS Word again!

+ Hour 2: I looked up how to create nested lists in markdown and applied it to this journal. On the same [website](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/05-blockquotes.html) I found other interesting things and I applied them to my tutorial .md file:
    * Blockquotes: line starts with > 
    * Line Breaks: line ends with \
    * Ordered and Unordered lists
    * More about images and captions: ![image caption](image name)

+ Hour 3: Opened [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and tried to do Exercise 0. Couldn-t run python on the command line> bash gave me a "permission denied" message. I tried consulting online forums to solve the problem, but it didn't work. I installed Python 2.7, but it still didn't work. I downloaded ActiveState Python as suggested from *Learn Python the Hard Way*, but I don't know if installing it is a good idea. I got frustrated and decided to ask Prof. Smyth about it in tonight's class. Pushed journal to GitBash.

+ Hour 4: I borrowed *Learn Pyhton 3 the Hard Way* from the library yesterday. Did exercise 1-4 from the book.

## Week 4

+ Hour 1 
    * Downloaded Anaconda again and installed it according to Prof. Smyth's instructions
    * I did exercises 5-6 from *Learn Python the hard way*
    * Tried running Python from the command line. It says the version but doesn't run.

+ Hour 2
    * Used IDLE for *Learn Python the Hard Way*, exercises 7-10
    * Exercise 10 has a list of **Escape Sequences**, so I made a cheat sheet in Python. some of the escape sequences didn't work, maybe because I'm using IDLE?
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 3
    * Ex. 11-13 from *Learn Python the Hard Way*. Ran the script on the command line with inputs and variables, and it worked!

+ Hour 4
    * Ex. 14 - 15. This is fun. I kinda want to create my version of *Adventure* now...
    * Pushed goals and journal to GitHub

## Week 5

+ Hour 1

    * Wrote my Geospatial Humanities Project in Markdown with a Bibliography built on Zotero.
    * Reviewed the Markdown tutorial because I needed some info on how to convert files to PDF
    * Converted my escape_sequences.py to a .md file. However, I wasn't able to export to pdf from the command line because the command \: is unavailable in coding T1.

+ Hour 2

    * Created a .md file for my EdTech class project
    * Ex. 16 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way* . The script didn't work with VS and the command line, so I tried using IDLE. It works, if I do "Run Customized": I think there might be a problem with the path in Anaconda. I did the study drills, these were a little more challenging than usual! In the end, it worked.
    * Pushed to GitHub
    * Finished the [readings for Week 4](https://github.com/smythp/software-design-lab)

+ Hour 3

    * Ex. 17 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*. The study drill said to try and write all the program in one line, but mine didn't work. I'll try again when I'm a little more comfortable with Python.
    * Ex. 18: the program did run, but I haven't really grasped what to use it for. I'll see if the next exercises make it clearer.
    * Ex. 19: as the study drills suggested, I created my own function, including one where the user gives an input for the variables. However, I didn't do it in 10 different way, only 5.
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 4

    * Ex. 20 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*. Not bad, it worked! And I discovered what "seek" does and what is "+="
    * Ex. 21. It took me a bit to understand the "return" word and what it does, but in the end, it made sense.
    * Ex. 22: this is about writing a list of all the words I learnt in Python (called list_of_words.md) and what they do. I created a text file and I'll write a bit of it every time I practice and push it to GitHub (hopefully)
    * Pushed the list_of_words to Github!
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 5
    * Wrote my paper for Geospatial Humanities in markdown. Then, I exported it in Word to adjust the style (footnotes, images), and then exported it to PDF.

## Week 6

+ Hour 1

    * Installed Jekyll
    * [HTML Tutorial on W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
    * Created my html page for recipes! With picture and a list. And navigation bar.

+ Hour 2

    * Downloaded Zoom for class
    * Kept working on my html page. Added a poem between blockquotes.
    * Committed journal to GitHub.
+ Hour 3

    * Worked on my html page: added a link to a heading, changed style of one of the headings with the id tag.
    * Kept going through the HTML Tutorial
    * Created a second html page (connected to the first one) with a conversions table for US and metric system.

+ Hour 4

    * Set up the viewport meta for my html page...I din't thinki I could do responsive design on HTML this easily!

+ Hour 5: wrote my Geospatial Humanities assignment in markdown. I exported it to Word so I could add images, then exported it to PDF.

## Week 7

+ Hour 1: Kept working on my html document with [HTML Tutorial on W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp). 

    * HTML Responsive
    * HTML Computercode
    * HTML Semantics: tried to add a "figure" section to contain the image on mt html page, but the caption ends up under the paragraph instead of the picture. I don't know why. I tried removing the "hr" spacing, but it didn't fix it.
    * HTML Entities
    * HTML Symbols
    * HTML Emojis: added an emoji to my html page. Honestly, it's interesting that there are so many things I can do, but I think I'll just search for them as I need them...I don't think it would be useful to learn all these special symbols and characters.
    * HTML Charset
    * HTML URL Encode: Finally I understand what the different parts of a URL are.
    * HTML XHTML
    * HTML Style Guide: this was useful...my html looks pretty messy at this point, so I'm gonna make it tidier.

+ Hour 2:
    * Pushed journal to GitHub
    * Tidied up my html page according to the HTML Style guide
    * Ex. 23 from *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*. It doesn't run. Also, I don't know what's the goal in this one.

+ Hour 3:
    * Ex. 24: I'm still a little confused about variables and what happens when you change names. I wish this book explained thing a bit more instead of just asking me to copy some code...
    * I got a little frustrated with *Learn Python the Hard Way* and its lack of explanation, so I decided to check out the [Python Tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp). I did the Python Quiz and scored 10 out of 25, which kind of sucks. I'll try their Tutorial and see.
        1. Python Intro
        2. Python Get Started
        3. Python Syntax
        4. Python Comments
        5. Python Variables
    * Pushed journal to GitHub

+ Hour 4: continued with the [Python Tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp). I like their method! They explain what's going on.
    * Python Data Types
    * Python Numbers
    * Python Casting
    * Python Strings
    * Pyhton Booleans: I had to Google what "Boolean" means(a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”.). I discovered it's called this way from George Boole †1864, English mathematician.
    * Python Operators
    * Python Lists
    * Python Tuples
    * Pushed Journal to GitHub.

+ Hour 5: more [Python Tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp).
    * Python Sets
    * Python Dictionaries
    * Python If...Else
    * Python While Loops
    * Python For Loops
    * Python Functions
    * Pushed Journal to GitHub

## Week 8

This week I wrote another paper in markdown, but for some reason I can't get the Bibliography when I convert it to Word or PDF. I went through the markdown tutorial and it seems like I did everything they way I was supposed to, I can't figure out what went wrong. This is a little frustrating!

+ Hour 1: More HTML from [w3 Schools!](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)
    * HTML Forms
    * HTML Form Elements
    * HTML Input Types
    * HTML Input Attributes
    * HTML Input Form Attributes: This was all very nice, but I don't know where to output the data from the form, even just to test it out!

+ Hour 2: More *Learn Python the Hard Way*
    * Ex. 23: I went back to this one to see if I can understand it better after the Python workshop during class on 3/25. I'm still quite perplexed and the script does not run on the command line or on IDLE.
    * Ex. 24. I reviewed this one. After the class, this is more clear.
    * Ex. 25: I can't run python on the command line, but I tried doing it on IDLE and it worked! 
    * Ex. 26: Yeah! I corrected all the bugs!

+ Hour 3: learning [CSS from w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    * Tried the quiz: I scored 64%. Meh.
    * CSS Introduction
    * CSS Syntax
    * CSS Selectors
    * CSS How To: I created an external CSS Stylesheet for my HTML pages. Wow, It was way easier than I thought!

+ Hour 4: more [CSS from w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    * CSS Comments
    * CSS Colors: This was included in the HTML tutorial
    * CSS Backgrounds + exercises
    * CSS Borders + exercises

## Week 9
I thought about my final project and came up with a couple of ideas, which I wrote in Markdown and pushed to GitHub. Then, I wrote down questions for prof. Smyth during class on April 1st. During class I had the opportunity to discuss my ideas with other students and I decided to pursue one of the two projects: the static website on Jekyll. I think it would be the most useful thing to practice, since I've always wanted to be able to design my own website.

## Week 10

+ Hour 1: I started to create the framework for my final project: a static website on Jekyll. I decided to track my progress on this journal, so all the journaling is in one place and the [Final-Project folder on GitHub](https://github.com/eaboumrad/Final-Project) only contains the final project files.
    * Created the README.md file and pushed to GitHub  (with command line)
    * created the about.md file and pushed to GitHub (with command line)
    * Define a **SCOPE**: creating a static website on Jekyll about the connection of food and poetry. It will be like arecipe blog, but where every poem has a corresponding recipe. There will be a section with measurement conversions: ideally in Python, where the program converts quantities; realistically, a table. The website will be screen-reader friendly and have elements of responsive design.
    * I'm trying to design the structure of the website in a markdown file, so that I can have a sort of checklist of things to do.
    * created a to-do list and pushed it to GitHub.

## Week 11:

+ Hour 1: started the [Jekyll tutorial on *Programming Historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). I found their Markdown tutorial very well done and I keep going back at it. For some mysterious reason, my folder for github is at the end of a very long path. I'll keep it here for easy access: "C:\Users\elena\Anaconda3\pkgs\spyder-3.3.6-py37_0\Lib\site-packages\spyder\widgets\github"

+ Hour 2: started playing with Jekyll. Created the [website](https://eaboumrad.github.io/foodpoetry/) and one new post. Pushed the repository to GitHub with GitHub Desktop and created a branch.

+ Hour 3: tried to [add a customized theme](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) to my website. I chose cayman for now...most of the themes look very tacky. On the first try (jekyll-theme-cayman), the website wouldn't open. Second try - the same. Then I remembered that I have to run the website locally when I change _config.yml. Now my website opens, but the theme isn't there. I still have to get a hang of this part. I think I would be better off with creating my own CSS stylesheet.

+ Hour 4: wrote my first post on the website. I managed to create a nice blockquote for the poem using HTML language. Then, I tried to insert an image like I did on HTML, but it all went wrong: the image does not appear and the rest of the text is all jammed together instead of a list. I guess I can't mix kramdown and HTML. This is messy. Here's a list of useful links I'm using:
