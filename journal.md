# Journal

## Week 1:

+ Hour 1: Went through the command line tutorial. Solving the challenges was fun

+ Hour 2: did the extra challenges. Struggled a bit with #3: making alias permanent, but then I read the blog and edited the file .bash_profile and it worked! Got lost on Challenge 5, I can’t find the Git folder in c:/program files. Tried to go to GitBash, find path, create goto-projects in that folder (with touch), edited file and saved, but when I ran Gitbash the command didn’t work

+ Hour 3: read the “Additional commands” section and tried them out. Read glossary.

## Week 2

+ Hour 1: reviewed the *Command Line Crash Course*, downloaded *Anaconda*, created **journal.md** and started writing it in markdown. Read the original markdown post and tried some instructions. Decided to follow the [tutorial of *programming historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) because I liked how clear and simple it looked. Downloaded software requested by *programming historian*. I couldn't remember how to push this journal to git hub, so I googled it. I pushed the most recent version of this journal to GitHub.

+ Hour 2: installed Pandoc and Zotero. Learned what YAML metadata blocks are. Followed the *programming historian* tutorial and wrote

    * a poem
    * a shopping list for groceries
    * a poem by Dante with footnotes and an image with a caption! [^1]

[^1]: all of it in markdown, obviously

I also converted the .md file to .docx. When I opened it with word, I realized I had made a mistake: I didn't put a space after the # sign and my heading didn't look like a heading.

+ Hour 3: I converted my .md file into an html file! Installed Latex through <miktex.org> so that I can convert the file to **PDF** as well. Started reading about *Working with Bibliographies* while Latex downloads. I haven't been able to convert to PDF yet.

+ Hour 4: Tried again to convert my .md file to pdf from the command line. Had to wait a little bit (more packages were installing), but then it succeeded. Opened Zotero and saved some articles through the Chrome extension. Created a .bib file and opened it in VS. On the 9th try, I managed to create a footnote with my citation and a bibliography on a PDF file! Then, pushed this journal to GitHub.

## Week 3

+ Hour 1: Downloaded the MLA.csl and changed the style of the citations. Saved a pdf. Played more with citations and different styles. Checked for updates of MikTex because the command line kept suggesting it. Applied the YAML metadata to this journal. Never going back to MS Word again!

+ Hour 2: I looked up how to create nested lists in markdown and applied it to this journal. On the same [website](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/05-blockquotes.html) I found other interesting things and I applied them to my tutorial .md file:
    * Blockquotes: line starts with > 
    * Line Breaks: line ends with \
    * Ordered and Unordered lists
    * More about images and captions: ![image caption](image name)

+ Hour 3: Opened [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and tried to do Exercise 0. Couldn-t run python on the command line> bash gave me a "permission denied" message. I tried consulting online forums to solve the problem, but it didn't work. I installed Python 2.7, but it still didn't work. I downloaded ActiveState Python as suggested from *Learn Python the Hard Way*, but I don't know if installing it is a good idea. I got frustrated and decided to ask Prof. Smyth about it in tonight's class. Pushed journal to GitBash.
